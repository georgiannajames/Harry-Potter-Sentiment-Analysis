# Harry-Potter-Sentiment-Analysis

Author: Georgianna James

## Summary

In this repo, I conduct a sentiment analysis on the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling.


## Required Packages

## Data

Run the following code in your console to retrieve the Harry Potter package used in this repo:

```devtools::install_github("bradleyboehmke/harrypotter")```

Once you have this package installed, you can load the "harrypotter" library as you normally would:

```library(harrypotter)```

The details of this package can be found on the associated [github repository](https://github.com/bradleyboehmke/harrypotter). 

## Resources

This sentiment analysis was derived from an [in-class exercise](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/notes/harry-potter-exercise/) for the course [MACS 30500](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/).
